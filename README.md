From the Executive Summary

The objective of this study was to assess, from publically available data of the SpaceX company, the success and failures associated with their efforts to reliably land and re-use the first stage component of their Falcon 9 rocket launches.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8529244/170352609-517d4ab5-a72f-4d74-879b-50127e35bedd.png)

Our company, SpaceY, will develop from the SpaceX data, predictive models for successful first stage landing and re-use, that are based on correlations among data that indicate relevant contribution to successful landings and re-use.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8529244/170352697-c638dbc8-b7df-4042-a48d-9d40a5f4c6cd.png)

Predicting success of Falcon 9 First Stage landing and re-use, from SpaceX data, is instrumental to the SpaceY strategy to make our space launch projects competitively priced vis-Ã -vis SpaceX and other space launch companies.
